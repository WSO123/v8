// - When a thread owns a mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to
//   |Lock()|) or receive a |false| return value (for |TryLock()|) if they
//   attempt to claim ownership of the mutex.
// A calling thread must not own the mutex prior to calling |Lock()| or
// |TryLock()|. The behavior of a program is undefined if a mutex is destroyed
// while still owned by some thread. The Mutex class is non-copyable.

//   when it successfully calls either |Lock()| or |TryLock()|. During this
//   period, the thread may make additional calls to |Lock()| or |TryLock()|.
//   The period of ownership ends when the thread makes a matching number of
//   calls to |Unlock()|.
// - When a thread owns a recursive mutex, all other threads will block (for
//   calls to |Lock()|) or receive a |false| return value (for |TryLock()|) if
//   they attempt to claim ownership of the recursive mutex.
// - The maximum number of times that a recursive mutex may be locked is
//   unspecified, but after that number is reached, calls to |Lock()| will
//   probably abort the process and calls to |TryLock()| return false.
// The behavior of a program is undefined if a recursive mutex is destroyed
// while still owned by some thread. The RecursiveMutex class is non-copyable.
